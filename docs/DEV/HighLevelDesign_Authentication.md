# High-Level Design: Authentication

## 1. Executive Summary
The Authentication feature aims to establish a robust and secure user authentication system, serving as a foundational element for a broader enterprise web application. This system will enable user identification, personalize user experiences, enhance platform security, and ensure data protection. The immediate focus is on core authentication functionalities: user registration, secure login, account recovery (password reset via email), and secure session management (logout). Future iterations will expand to include social logins and two-factor authentication.

Key architectural decisions leverage the existing technology stack, primarily a .NET 9.0/ABP Framework 8.3.0 backend and a Next.js 14+/React 18.3+ frontend, which are well-aligned with requirements for security, performance, and scalability. The system will follow a Modular Monolith architecture with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Clean Architecture principles.

Business drivers include increasing user retention (targeting a 15% return rate after 7 days and 500 new accounts/week) and enhancing platform security (aiming for 0 critical security vulnerabilities related to authentication and API response times under 1.5 seconds at the 95th percentile). Technical constraints include mandatory Bcrypt hashing for passwords (cost factor 12) and time-limited password reset tokens (1 hour expiry).

The implementation strategy is phased over approximately 8 weeks: Phase 1 (Foundation & Technical Deep Dive), Phase 2 (Core Authentication Implementation), and Phase 3 (Password Reset & NFRs Validation).

Key risks include the ABP Framework learning curve for the team, limited n8n workflow automation expertise, and ensuring API performance under load. These will be mitigated through dedicated training, senior mentorship, and proactive testing.

Success criteria encompass technical aspects like functional completeness, performance, and security, business aspects such as user acceptance and support for business processes, and delivery aspects including adherence to timeline and effort estimates.

## 2. Requirements Analysis

### 2.1 Business Requirements Summary
The core business functions for the Authentication feature include:
- **Account Registration**: Users can create new accounts using email and password. The system will validate email format, ensure email uniqueness, and enforce password complexity rules (at least 8 characters, 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 digit).
- **Account Login**: Registered users can log in with their email and password. The system will temporarily lock accounts after 5 consecutive failed login attempts within 15 minutes.
- **Password Reset**: Users who forget their password can request a reset link sent to their email. The link will be time-limited (1 hour).
- **Account Logout**: Users can securely log out, which invalidates their current session.

User requirements emphasize quick registration (for "An - Người dùng khám phá"), fast and secure login (for "Bình - Người dùng trung thành"), and easy password recovery (for "Chi - Người dùng đãng trí").

Integration needs primarily involve internal REST API communication between the frontend and backend, and external integration with a third-party email service for password reset functionality.

Business constraints include:
- **Effort & Timeline**: The MVP is targeted for completion within Q1 (approximately 8 weeks).
- **Compliance**: No specific regulatory compliance is mentioned for authentication, but stringent security NFRs are critical.

    - **Infrastructure**: All application components (backend, frontend) depend on the underlying Docker, Nginx, and potentially cloud infrastructure.

## 8. Performance and Scalability Design

- **Performance Requirements**:
    - **Response Time**: Authentication APIs (login, register, reset password) MUST have a server-side response time under 800ms at the 95th percentile. (Backend target: < 200ms for API endpoints).
    - **Throughput**: The authentication system MUST be capable of serving 1,000 requests/second concurrently without increasing response time by more than 20%.
    - **Availability**: Authentication and email services MUST achieve 99.9% uptime.

- **Scalability Strategy**:
    - **Horizontal Scaling**: The stateless nature of the API (using JWT tokens) and containerization (Docker) allows for easy horizontal scaling of backend instances. Frontend (Next.js) can also be horizontally scaled.
    - **Vertical Scaling**: Database and Redis instances can be vertically scaled (upgraded to more powerful machines) as needed.
    - **Database Sharding/Replication**: TBD: [While not explicitly detailed for v1.0, for very high scale, database sharding or read replicas could be considered in future phases.]

- **Load Distribution**:
    - **Load Balancing**: A load balancer (e.g., Nginx, or a cloud provider's load balancer) will distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of the backend and frontend applications.
    - **Traffic Management**: TBD: [Specific traffic management strategies like API gateways or advanced routing are not explicitly mentioned for v1.0, but could be considered for future growth.]

- **Resource Optimization**:
    - **Caching**: Redis 7.0 will be used for high-performance caching of session data and potentially other frequently accessed, non-sensitive authentication-related data.
    - **Database Optimization**:
        -   Proper indexing will be applied to frequently queried columns (e.g., `Email Address` in User Account table).
        -   Database queries will be reviewed and optimized to ensure efficient data retrieval and updates.
        -   Entity Framework Core's change tracking and eager/lazy loading will be managed to prevent N+1 query issues.
    - **CDN**: TBD: [A CDN is not explicitly mentioned for the authentication feature, but could be used for static frontend assets in a broader application context.]
    - **Queueing**: Non-critical operations, such as sending password reset emails, can be offloaded to background queues (e.g., using RabbitMQ, which is part of the tech stack) to prevent blocking API responses and improve perceived performance.

## 9. Security Architecture

- **Security Framework**: The overall security approach is built upon the robust security features provided by the ABP Framework and ASP.NET Core, combined with best practices for frontend security. It emphasizes a defense-in-depth strategy, covering all layers from network to application logic.

- **Authentication & Authorization**:
    - **Authentication**:
        -   User authentication is primarily handled by **ABP Identity** and **ASP.NET Core Identity**.
        -   **JWT Bearer Tokens** are used for API authentication, providing a stateless mechanism for verifying user identity after initial login.
        -   **IdentityServer4/Duende** is available in the tech stack for OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect flows, providing a robust identity provider solution.
    - **Authorization**:
        -   Access control is managed through the **ABP Permission System**, allowing granular permissions based on user roles.

- **Data Security**:
    - **Password Hashing**: User passwords MUST be hashed using the `Bcrypt` algorithm with a cost factor of at least 12 (NFR-SEC-01). This ensures strong protection against brute-force attacks and rainbow table attacks.
    - **Token Security**:
        -   Password reset tokens are unique, randomly generated, and have a strict expiration time (60 minutes, NFR-SEC-04).
        -   Tokens are invalidated immediately after use to prevent replay attacks.
        -   Session tokens (JWT) automatically expire after 24 hours of inactivity (NFR-SEC-03).
    - **Data Protection**:
        -   Input validation is performed at both the frontend and backend to prevent common vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection.
        -   Entity Framework Core provides built-in protection against SQL Injection.
        -   Sensitive data at rest (e.g., hashed passwords, tokens) is stored securely in the database.

- **Network Security**:
    - **Communication Security**: All communication between the frontend and backend, and with external services, MUST be transmitted over `HTTPS (TLS 1.2+)` (NFR-SEC-02). TLS 1.3 will be enforced in production.
    - **CORS**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies will be properly configured to restrict access to the API from unauthorized domains.
    - **Rate Limiting**: Implemented on authentication endpoints (login, register, password reset request) to mitigate brute-force and denial-of-service attacks.
    - **API Security**: Adherence to secure API design principles, including proper authentication, authorization, and input validation.

- **Security Implementation Strategy**:
    - **Secure Coding**: Developers will adhere to secure coding guidelines, regularly updated with best practices.
    - **Security Testing**:
        -   **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)**: Automated code analysis integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to identify vulnerabilities early.
        -   **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)**: Scanning the running application for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
        -   **Manual Penetration Testing**: Engaging security experts to identify complex, logic-based vulnerabilities after initial feature implementation.
    - **Code Review**: Security-focused code reviews will be a mandatory part of the development process.
    - **Configuration Management**: Secure configuration of all application components, servers, and databases.

    - **Incident Response**: TBD: [A formal incident response plan for security breaches will be established.]

## 10. Integration Architecture

- **Internal Integrations**:
    - **Service-to-Service Communication**: Within the backend, components (Application Services, Domain Services, Repositories) communicate via direct method calls and dependency injection, following the Clean Architecture principles.
    - **Data Access**: Application services interact with the database through the Entity Framework Core ORM.
    - **Caching**: Backend services interact with Redis for caching and session management.
    - **Object Mapping**: AutoMapper is used for mapping between DTOs and domain entities.

- **External Integrations**:
    - **Third-Party Email Service**: The backend will integrate with a chosen third-party email service (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun) to send password reset emails. This integration will involve making API calls to the email service provider.
    - **API Client Development**: A dedicated API client will be developed within the backend to encapsulate communication with the external email service, handling request formatting, response parsing, and error handling.

- **Messaging Architecture**:
    - **RabbitMQ**: While RabbitMQ is part of the overall tech stack, its specific use case for the Authentication feature (v1.0) is TBD: [It is not explicitly mentioned how RabbitMQ will be used for authentication flows. It could be used for asynchronous processing of email sending or other background tasks to improve API response times, but this is not a defined requirement for v1.0.]

- **Error Handling**:
    - **Fault Tolerance**: Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for external service calls (e.g., to the email service) to handle transient failures.
    - **Circuit Breakers**: TBD: [Consider implementing circuit breakers for external service integrations to prevent cascading failures if an external dependency becomes unresponsive.]
    - **Clear Error Messages**: The system will return clear and user-friendly error messages to the frontend for invalid inputs, failed login attempts, or expired/invalid password reset links.
    - **Logging**: Comprehensive logging (using Serilog) will capture errors and exceptions across all layers to aid in troubleshooting and monitoring.
