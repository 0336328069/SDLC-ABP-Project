# System Architecture Design: Authentication

### 1. Executive Summary
The system aims to establish a robust and secure user authentication system, serving as a foundational element for a broader enterprise web application. The primary goal is to increase user retention by enabling account creation and recovery, and to enhance platform security and trustworthiness. The system will achieve a 15% increase in 7-day user retention and zero critical security vulnerabilities related to authentication.

The architectural strategy is based on a **Modular Monolith** leveraging **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and **Clean Architecture** principles, with **.NET 9.0** and **ABP Framework 8.3.0** for the backend, and **Next.js 14+** with **React 18.3+** for the frontend. Security is integrated throughout, with mandatory `HTTPS/TLS 1.2+`, `Bcrypt` hashing for passwords, and time-limited tokens. The system will support 1,000 concurrent requests/second with API response times under 800ms at the 95th percentile.

### 2. Architecture Principles and Patterns
- **Design Principles**:
    - **Modularity**: The system will be built as a Modular Monolith, allowing for clear separation of concerns and independent development of features. Rationale: Enhances maintainability and scalability. Impact on design: Clear boundaries between modules, especially for authentication.
    - **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Focus on the core business domain (Authentication) to drive the design. Rationale: Ensures the software aligns with business requirements. Impact on design: Entities like `User Account`, `Session`, and `Password Reset Token` are central.
    - **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns into layers (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation). Rationale: Promotes testability, maintainability, and independence from frameworks. Impact on design: Clear project structure in both backend and frontend.
    - **Responsiveness**: UI must be responsive. Rationale: Ensures optimal user experience across various devices. Impact on design: Use of `Tailwind CSS` and `Radix UI`.
- **Security Principles**:
    - **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls. Rationale: Reduces the impact of a single security control failure. Impact on security design: `HTTPS`, `Bcrypt` hashing, account lockout, token expiration.
    - **Least Privilege**: Users and processes should only have the minimum necessary access. Rationale: Limits potential damage from compromise. Impact on security design: ABP Permission System for authorization.
    - **Secure by Design**: Security considerations are integrated from the initial design phase. Rationale: Prevents vulnerabilities from being introduced early. Impact on security design: `Bcrypt` hashing, secure token generation, `HTTPS` enforcement.
    - **Data Protection**: Sensitive data is protected at rest and in transit. Rationale: Ensures confidentiality and integrity. Impact on security design: Password hashing, `HTTPS/TLS 1.2+`.
- **Architectural Patterns**:
    - **Modular Monolith**: Combines benefits of monolith (simplicity) with modularity (separation of concerns). Rationale: Provides a structured approach for enterprise applications. Implementation considerations: Clear module boundaries, inter-module communication. Security pattern integration: Allows for security controls to be applied at module level.
    - **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts data access logic. Rationale: Decouples application from data storage technology. Implementation considerations: `Entity Framework Core` for ORM.
    - **REST API**: Standardized communication between frontend and backend. Rationale: Interoperability and simplicity. Implementation considerations: `ASP.NET Core Web API`. Security pattern integration: `JWT Bearer Tokens` for API authentication.
