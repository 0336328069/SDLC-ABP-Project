# Book Management Domain Model - Business Logic Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the business logic, rules, and workflows implemented in the Book Management domain model. The domain model follows Domain-Driven Design principles and implements library management patterns using ABP Framework.

## Business Rules

### Book Registration Rules

1. **ISBN Uniqueness**: Each book must have a unique ISBN across the system
   - Implemented in: Domain service validation
   - Validation occurs at application layer before entity creation
   - Supports both ISBN-10 and ISBN-13 formats

2. **Title and Author Requirements**: Books must have valid title and at least one author
   - Minimum title length: 3 characters
   - Maximum title length: 200 characters
   - At least one author must be specified
   - Implemented in: `BookTitle` and `Author` value objects validation

3. **Publication Date Validation**: Publication date must be realistic
   - Cannot be in the future
   - Cannot be before year 1000 (reasonable historical limit)
   - Implemented in: `PublicationDate` value object

4. **Category Assignment**: Books must be assigned to at least one category
   - Books can belong to multiple categories
   - Category must exist in the system
   - Implemented in: Application service layer validation

### Inventory Management Rules

5. **Stock Tracking**: System tracks available and total quantities
   - Available quantity cannot exceed total quantity
   - Available quantity cannot be negative
   - Implemented in: `BookInventory` value object

6. **Reservation Logic**: Books can be reserved by users
   - Cannot reserve more books than available
   - Reservations expire after 24 hours if not borrowed
   - Implemented in: `BookReservation` entity

### Borrowing Rules

7. **Borrow Limits**: Users have borrowing limits based on membership type
   - Regular members: 5 books maximum
   - Premium members: 10 books maximum
   - Student members: 3 books maximum
   - Implemented in: Domain service `BookBorrowingService`

8. **Due Date Calculation**: Return due dates based on book type
   - Regular books: 14 days
   - Reference books: 7 days
   - New releases: 7 days
   - Implemented in: `BorrowPeriod` value object

### Return and Fine Rules

9. **Late Return Fines**: Fines calculated for overdue books
   - Regular books: $0.50 per day
   - Reference books: $1.00 per day
   - New releases: $1.50 per day
   - Maximum fine per book: $20.00
   - Implemented in: `Fine` value object

10. **Book Condition Assessment**: Books assessed for damage on return
    - Good, Fair, Poor, Damaged conditions
    - Damage fines applied based on replacement cost
    - Implemented in: `BookCondition` value object

## Entity Behaviors

### Book Entity

The `Book` entity represents the core book information and inventory:

**Key Properties**:
- ISBN (unique identifier)
- Title, subtitle, description
- Authors, publisher, publication date
- Categories, language, pages
- Physical properties (dimensions, weight)

**Key Methods**:
- `AddAuthor()`: Adds author to book
- `RemoveAuthor()`: Removes author (minimum one required)
- `UpdateInventory()`: Updates stock quantities
- `CanBeBorrowed()`: Checks if book is available for borrowing
- `Reserve()`: Creates reservation for user
- `CancelReservation()`: Cancels existing reservation

### BookReservation Entity

The `BookReservation` entity manages book reservations:

**Key Methods**:
- `IsExpired()`: Checks if reservation has expired (24 hours)
- `ConvertToBorrow()`: Converts reservation to active borrow
- `Cancel()`: Cancels reservation and frees book

**Business Logic**:
- Reservations automatically expire after 24 hours
- One user can only have one active reservation per book
- Reserved books are not available for direct borrowing

### BookBorrow Entity

The `BookBorrow` entity tracks borrowed books:

**Key Methods**:
- `IsOverdue()`: Checks if book is past due date
- `CalculateFine()`: Calculates late return fine
- `Return()`: Processes book return with condition assessment
- `Renew()`: Extends due date if allowed

**Business Logic**:
- Due date calculated based on book type and borrow date
- Renewals allowed once if no reservations pending
- Overdue calculation includes weekends and holidays

### Category Entity

The `Category` entity organizes books into logical groupings:

**Key Properties**:
- Name, description, parent category
- Active status, display order

**Key Methods**:
- `AddSubcategory()`: Creates child category
- `MoveToCategory()`: Changes parent category
- `GetBookCount()`: Returns number of books in category
