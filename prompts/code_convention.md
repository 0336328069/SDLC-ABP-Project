**IMPORTANT:** This assessment focuses on creating practical coding standards and conventions for source code development that ensure code quality, maintainability, and effective team collaboration. The conventions must be built upon the technical architecture decisions and technology stack selections from the high-level design. **Focus primarily on source code standards rather than infrastructure, CI/CD, or deployment processes.**

* `docs/DEV/HighLevelDesign_[FeatureName].md` - Provides system architecture and design patterns
* `docs/DEV/ERD_[FeatureName].md` - Defines data models and database schema

**Code Convention Development Analysis:**

**1. High-Level Design Analysis:**
From High-Level Design Document: {{high_level_design_document}}
Extract all technical architecture and design decisions needed for coding standards.

**Analyze design foundation:**
- Approved technology stack (programming languages, frameworks, databases)
- System architecture patterns and component design principles
- Database design and data access patterns from ERD specifications
- Security requirements for code implementation
- Performance requirements that affect coding patterns
- API design standards and integration patterns
