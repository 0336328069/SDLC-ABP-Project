  ## 4. SERVICE-SPECIFIC INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS

  ### AUTHENTICATION SERVICES (Google OAuth, Auth0, etc.)
  ```csharp
  // Required Components:
  - OAuth flow implementation
  - Token validation and refresh
  - User profile mapping
  - Social login UI integration
  - Account linking strategies

  EMAIL SERVICES (SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.)

  // Required Components:
  - Template management

  5. INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS

  ADAPTER PATTERN IMPLEMENTATION

  // Domain Layer
  public interface IEmailService
  {
      Task<EmailResult> SendAsync(EmailMessage message);
  }

  // Infrastructure Layer
  public class SendGridEmailService : IEmailService
  public class MailgunEmailService : IEmailService

  // Configuration Layer
  services.AddScoped<IEmailService, SendGridEmailService>();

  STRATEGY PATTERN FOR MULTIPLE PROVIDERS

  public interface IPaymentProcessor
  {
      Task<PaymentResult> ProcessAsync(PaymentRequest request);
  }

  public class PaymentProcessorFactory
  {
      public IPaymentProcessor GetProcessor(PaymentMethod method);
  }

  6. FAILURE SCENARIOS & MITIGATION

  THIRD-PARTY SERVICE DOWNTIME

  - Circuit breaker implementation
  - Fallback service alternatives
  - Graceful degradation strategies
  - User communication plans

  RATE LIMITING & QUOTAS

  - Priority-based processing
  - Usage monitoring and alerts
  - Cost optimization strategies

  DATA CONSISTENCY ISSUES

  7. CONFIGURATION & SECRETS MANAGEMENT

  ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATIONS

  {
    "ThirdPartyServices": {
      "Google": {
        "ClientId": "{{GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID}}",
        "ClientSecret": "{{GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET}}",
